# Instructor Demo: Command Line

## Introduction to the Terminal

The terminal, also known as the command line or shell, is a powerful tool that allows users to interact directly with their computer's operating system through text-based commands. Mastering the terminal is essential for developers, system administrators, and anyone looking to leverage the full potential of their system.

### Why Use the Terminal?

- **Efficiency**: Quickly perform complex tasks that would take longer through a graphical interface.
- **Automation**: Easily automate repetitive tasks using scripts.
- **Remote Management**: Manage systems remotely without needing a graphical interface.

## Basic Terminal Commands

### Listing Directory Contents

* Use `ls` to list the contents of the current directory. This command reveals directories and files within your present working directory, providing an overview of available items.

```bash
ls
```

### Changing Directories

* Use `cd` to navigate between directories. For example, to move into the `Desktop` directory:

```bash
cd Desktop
```

* To return to the previous directory, use `cd ..`:

```bash
cd ..
```

### Checking the Current Directory

* Use `pwd` to print the working directory. This command displays the full path of the current directory, helping you keep track of your location within the file system.

```bash
pwd
```

### Creating and Managing Directories

* Navigate into the `Desktop` directory:

```bash
cd Desktop
```

* Create a new directory named `demo-folder`:

```bash
mkdir demo-folder
```

* Change into the `demo-folder` directory:

```bash
cd demo-folder
```

* Create a new file named `index.html`:

```bash
touch index.html
```

* Verify the file has been created using `ls`:

```bash
ls
```

## Commonly Used Commands

### Viewing File Contents

* Use `cat` to display the contents of a file:

```bash
cat index.html
```

### Removing Files and Directories

* Use `rm` to delete a file:

```bash
rm index.html
```

* Use `rmdir` to delete an empty directory or `rm -r` to delete a directory and its contents:

```bash
rmdir demo-folder
rm -r demo-folder
```

### Copying and Moving Files

* Use `cp` to copy files:

```bash
cp index.html index_backup.html
```

* Use `mv` to move or rename files:

```bash
mv index.html new_index.html
```

## Advanced Navigation and File Management

### Searching Files

* Use `grep` to search within files:

```bash
grep 'search_term' index.html
```

### Viewing Hidden Files

* Use `ls -a` to view hidden files, which start with a dot (`.`):

```bash
ls -a
```

### Creating Nested Directories

* Use `mkdir -p` to create nested directories in a single command:

```bash
mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild
```

### Moving and Copying Directories

* Use `mv` to move directories:

```bash
mv demo-folder new-folder
```

* Use `cp -r` to copy directories recursively:

```bash
cp -r demo-folder copy-of-demo-folder
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

* `command not found`: The command entered is not recognized by the terminal.
* `No such file or directory`: The specified file or directory does not exist.
* `Permission denied`: Insufficient permissions to perform the action.

### Handling Errors

* Double-check the command for typos.
* Ensure the correct path is specified.
* Use `sudo` to execute commands with superuser privileges (be cautious with this):

```bash
sudo command
```

## Best Practices

* **Tab Completion**: Use tab completion to quickly complete file and directory names.
* **Command History**: Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through command history.
* **Safety First**: Be cautious with commands that modify or delete files (`rm`, `mv`). Always double-check before executing.
* **Use Aliases**: Create aliases for frequently used commands to save time:

```bash
alias ll='ls -la'
```

* **Regular Cleanup**: Regularly clean up unused files and directories to keep your workspace organized.
